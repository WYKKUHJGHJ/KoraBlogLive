## Market Overview

Today’s crypto market presented a mixed performance as Bitcoin (BTC) held steady above $63,000, while several major altcoins experienced mild corrections after recent rallies.

- **ARB**: $1.12 (+3.4%)

## Key Drivers

- **U.S. CPI Data Released**: Inflation showed signs of cooling at 3.3% YoY, reinforcing expectations that the Fed may pause further rate hikes. This contributed to early optimism in the crypto markets.
- **Ethereum Gas Fees**: Slight increase in L1 congestion led to elevated fees; activity on L2 networks like Arbitrum and Base continues to climb.
- **Altcoin Rotation**: Traders rotated from meme tokens into infrastructure and AI-related tokens. Projects with real utility saw stronger support.

## On-Chain Observations

- **BTC Netflow**: Exchange outflows dominated, suggesting accumulation continues.  
- **ETH Staking**: Lido and EigenLayer saw fresh inflows.  
- **USDT Supply on Exchanges**: Rose by 1.7%, suggesting capital readiness for new positions.

## Top Gainers (24h)

1. **AR (Arweave)**: +18.2%  
2. **RNDR (Render)**: +9.7%  
3. **TAO (Bittensor)**: +7.4%

## Analyst Commentary

> “We’re entering a consolidation phase after last week’s rally. BTC dominance is rising slightly, but altcoins still show strength. Watch closely for volatility around this week’s macroeconomic events.”

## Summary

The market is stabilizing after volatility earlier this month. Traders are watching for follow-up confirmation from the Fed and continued institutional flows. Risk remains moderate; strategies favor a selective altcoin rotation with emphasis on fundamentals and L2 ecosystems.
